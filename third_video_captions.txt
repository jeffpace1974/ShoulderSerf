over the past two years my AI agency
over the past two years my AI agency morning side AI has built AI systems for
morning side AI has built AI systems for
morning side AI has built AI systems for companies of all sizes from local
companies of all sizes from local
companies of all sizes from local martial arts gyms to publicly traded
martial arts gyms to publicly traded
martial arts gyms to publicly traded companies and even an NBA team and at
companies and even an NBA team and at
companies and even an NBA team and at the core of every one of our client
the core of every one of our client
the core of every one of our client projects are a handful of powerful AI
projects are a handful of powerful AI
projects are a handful of powerful AI prompts which in a few hundred carefully
prompts which in a few hundred carefully
prompts which in a few hundred carefully chosen words can automate hundreds or
chosen words can automate hundreds or
chosen words can automate hundreds or even thousands of hours of manual work
even thousands of hours of manual work
even thousands of hours of manual work so being able to write really really
so being able to write really really
so being able to write really really good prompts like these is a superpower
good prompts like these is a superpower
good prompts like these is a superpower these days regardless of what career
these days regardless of what career
these days regardless of what career you're in but the tricky thing is that
you're in but the tricky thing is that
you're in but the tricky thing is that writing these kinds of really good
writing these kinds of really good
writing these kinds of really good prompts usually takes a lot of time and
prompts usually takes a lot of time and
prompts usually takes a lot of time and effort realizing this at Morningside AI
effort realizing this at Morningside AI
effort realizing this at Morningside AI it became a major priority for us to
it became a major priority for us to
it became a major priority for us to figure out how to write these kind of
figure out how to write these kind of
figure out how to write these kind of elite production grade prompts for our
elite production grade prompts for our
elite production grade prompts for our client projects as quickly as possible
client projects as quickly as possible
client projects as quickly as possible and so over the past 2 years using the
and so over the past 2 years using the
and so over the past 2 years using the latest in AI prompting research and
latest in AI prompting research and
latest in AI prompting research and professional grade prompting software we
professional grade prompting software we
professional grade prompting software we created our own rapid prompt engineering
created our own rapid prompt engineering
created our own rapid prompt engineering system called the Peter process and in
system called the Peter process and in
system called the Peter process and in this video I'm going to be revealing our
this video I'm going to be revealing our
this video I'm going to be revealing our entire system including the exact prompt
entire system including the exact prompt
entire system including the exact prompt engineering tools and software we use
engineering tools and software we use
engineering tools and software we use and the process as well that we use at
and the process as well that we use at
and the process as well that we use at Morningside AI to craft hyper effective
Morningside AI to craft hyper effective
Morningside AI to craft hyper effective prompts in just minutes that are able to
prompts in just minutes that are able to
prompts in just minutes that are able to extract the most value from AI models
extract the most value from AI models
extract the most value from AI models possible without having to spend all day
possible without having to spend all day
possible without having to spend all day writing and testing those prompts so
writing and testing those prompts so
writing and testing those prompts so we're going to start quickly with an
we're going to start quickly with an
we're going to start quickly with an overview of the Peter framework and then
overview of the Peter framework and then
overview of the Peter framework and then diving into a more Hands-On walkthrough
diving into a more Hands-On walkthrough
diving into a more Hands-On walkthrough of exactly what it looks like when it's
of exactly what it looks like when it's
of exactly what it looks like when it's in action and we're basically going to
in action and we're basically going to
in action and we're basically going to be building a business grade prompt from
be building a business grade prompt from
be building a business grade prompt from scratch using this process so whether
scratch using this process so whether
scratch using this process so whether you're an employee who's just keen on
you're an employee who's just keen on
you're an employee who's just keen on automating some of the work you do or
automating some of the work you do or
automating some of the work you do or you're an AI agency owner wanting to
you're an AI agency owner wanting to
you're an AI agency owner wanting to deliver better client results and more
deliver better client results and more
deliver better client results and more consistently or if you're a business
consistently or if you're a business
consistently or if you're a business owner and you're looking to train up
owner and you're looking to train up
owner and you're looking to train up your own team on how to write prompts
your own team on how to write prompts
your own team on how to write prompts well and write them fast and be able to
well and write them fast and be able to
well and write them fast and be able to automate their own work then this video
automate their own work then this video
automate their own work then this video will show you how the professionals do
will show you how the professionals do
will show you how the professionals do it so first and foremost let's just talk
it so first and foremost let's just talk
it so first and foremost let's just talk about what makes prompt engineering so
about what makes prompt engineering so
about what makes prompt engineering so powerful right it's kind of overused and
powerful right it's kind of overused and
powerful right it's kind of overused and over talked about but when done right it
over talked about but when done right it
over talked about but when done right it is essentially like having a magic wand

is essentially like having a magic wand that can transform data from one form
that can transform data from one form
that can transform data from one form into another you're taking some kind of
into another you're taking some kind of
into another you're taking some kind of raw information and then turning it into
raw information and then turning it into
raw information and then turning it into something valuable just by writing some
something valuable just by writing some
something valuable just by writing some magic words in the middle it's pretty
magic words in the middle it's pretty
magic words in the middle it's pretty magical when you think about it but
magical when you think about it but
magical when you think about it but here's the reality that most people face
here's the reality that most people face
here's the reality that most people face right there's a massive difference
right there's a massive difference
right there's a massive difference between casual prompting that most
between casual prompting that most
between casual prompting that most people do and professional prompt
people do and professional prompt
people do and professional prompt engineering which is what I'm going to
engineering which is what I'm going to

when you are just chatting to chat gbt
when you are just chatting to chat gbt you can go back and forth and you can
you can go back and forth and you can
you can go back and forth and you can kind of refine your requests by asking
kind of refine your requests by asking
kind of refine your requests by asking follow-up prompts and sending more more

realizing the difference between these good and great prompts and how much
good and great prompts and how much
good and great prompts and how much extra leg work you can get the AI
extra leg work you can get the AI
extra leg work you can get the AI systems to do with the great prompts but
systems to do with the great prompts but

also factoring in that these take a lot
also factoring in that these take a lot longer to write that we decided to
longer to write that we decided to
longer to write that we decided to create our own process at morning side
create our own process at morning side
create our own process at morning side AI to always get the best prompts that
AI to always get the best prompts that
AI to always get the best prompts that get the most out of AI models without

systematic approach that allows us to
systematic approach that allows us to create these high performing prompts in
create these high performing prompts in
create these high performing prompts in a fraction of the time that it would

just for our AI engineers and developers when they're doing client work it's it's
when they're doing client work it's it's
when they're doing client work it's it's helpful to teach our entire team so that
helpful to teach our entire team so that

you need the prompt to do before even
you need the prompt to do before even writing a single word so this is
writing a single word so this is

I'm going to be sharing all of these
I'm going to be sharing all of these tools with you for free that we use at
tools with you for free that we use at
tools with you for free that we use at morning side so you're going to get
morning side so you're going to get
morning side so you're going to get access to our prompt planning worksheet
access to our prompt planning worksheet
access to our prompt planning worksheet our AI prompt generator tool and also a

we use as well and so for the rest of
we use as well and so for the rest of this video to show you how this looks in
this video to show you how this looks in
this video to show you how this looks in action I'm going to be walking you
action I'm going to be walking you
action I'm going to be walking you through each step of the Peter process
through each step of the Peter process
through each step of the Peter process while actually building a production
while actually building a production
while actually building a production grade prompt from scratch so you're
grade prompt from scratch so you're
grade prompt from scratch so you're going to get to see exactly how we do it
going to get to see exactly how we do it
going to get to see exactly how we do it at morning side with nothing held back
at morning side with nothing held back
at morning side with nothing held back so let's start with the first component
so let's start with the first component
so let's start with the first component which is
which is
which is planning the planning phase is where
planning the planning phase is where
planning the planning phase is where most people go wrong before they even
most people go wrong before they even
most people go wrong before they even started really they just jump straight
started really they just jump straight
started really they just jump straight into writing a prompt without clearly
into writing a prompt without clearly
into writing a prompt without clearly defining what they needed to do so at
defining what they needed to do so at
defining what they needed to do so at morning side we start every prompt with
morning side we start every prompt with
morning side we start every prompt with a planning worksheet that answers some
a planning worksheet that answers some
a planning worksheet that answers some very key questions that you need to know
very key questions that you need to know
very key questions that you need to know before going into things questions like
before going into things questions like
before going into things questions like what are the inputs and what data is
what are the inputs and what data is
what are the inputs and what data is this prompt actually going to be
this prompt actually going to be
this prompt actually going to be processing what format does the output
processing what format does the output
processing what format does the output need to be in where can I find some high
need to be in where can I find some high
need to be in where can I find some high quality examples of input and output
quality examples of input and output
quality examples of input and output pairs which model should be used based
pairs which model should be used based
pairs which model should be used based on the budget and performance needs of
on the budget and performance needs of
on the budget and performance needs of this prompt and of this use case what
this prompt and of this use case what
this prompt and of this use case what are the specific requirements or
are the specific requirements or
are the specific requirements or constraints that have come to me from
constraints that have come to me from
constraints that have come to me from the client or from the the project as a
the client or from the the project as a
the client or from the the project as a whole so this planning phase typically
whole so this planning phase typically
whole so this planning phase typically takes 5 to 10 minutes but it can save
takes 5 to 10 minutes but it can save
takes 5 to 10 minutes but it can save hours and hours of frustration later so
hours and hours of frustration later so
hours and hours of frustration later so here on screen we have the prompt
here on screen we have the prompt
here on screen we have the prompt planning sheet which you guys are going
planning sheet which you guys are going
planning sheet which you guys are going to be able to get a copy of this is a
to be able to get a copy of this is a
to be able to get a copy of this is a resource directly out of my accelerator
resource directly out of my accelerator
resource directly out of my accelerator as with some of the other stuff I'm
as with some of the other stuff I'm
as with some of the other stuff I'm going to be sharing now before we can
going to be sharing now before we can
going to be sharing now before we can actually get into planning we need to
actually get into planning we need to
actually get into planning we need to know what kind of prompt we're going to
know what kind of prompt we're going to
know what kind of prompt we're going to be writing so in this video I've come up
be writing so in this video I've come up
be writing so in this video I've come up with a hypothetical uh scenario say you
with a hypothetical uh scenario say you
with a hypothetical uh scenario say you are an AI automation agency delivering a
are an AI automation agency delivering a
are an AI automation agency delivering a project for a client or maybe you're a
project for a client or maybe you're a
project for a client or maybe you're a business and you're doing this
business and you're doing this
business and you're doing this internally but we're going to be
internally but we're going to be
internally but we're going to be creating a prompt that is an email order
creating a prompt that is an email order
creating a prompt that is an email order responder um that can basically classify
responder um that can basically classify
responder um that can basically classify inbound emails to this fantasy uh
inbound emails to this fantasy uh
inbound emails to this fantasy uh e-commerce that I've come up with which
e-commerce that I've come up with which
e-commerce that I've come up with which is called Tech Gear Pro and they sell
is called Tech Gear Pro and they sell
is called Tech Gear Pro and they sell Tech products online and this prompt
Tech products online and this prompt
Tech products online and this prompt that we're about to write is going to be
that we're about to write is going to be
that we're about to write is going to be attached to their uh email inbox so
attached to their uh email inbox so
attached to their uh email inbox so every new email is going to be run
every new email is going to be run
every new email is going to be run through the prompt we write and the
through the prompt we write and the
through the prompt we write and the prompt is basically expected to be able
prompt is basically expected to be able
prompt is basically expected to be able to classify firstly so what kind of
to classify firstly so what kind of
to classify firstly so what kind of query is this is asking about order
query is this is asking about order
query is this is asking about order status are they asking for a return or a
status are they asking for a return or a
status are they asking for a return or a refund are they having technical issues
refund are they having technical issues
refund are they having technical issues and they need technical support or does
and they need technical support or does
and they need technical support or does it fall outside of these so we have four
it fall outside of these so we have four
it fall outside of these so we have four broad categories and that's the
broad categories and that's the
broad categories and that's the classification step and then within each
classification step and then within each
classification step and then within each of these we have a bit more detail and a
of these we have a bit more detail and a
of these we have a bit more detail and a bit more complexity CU I thought that
bit more complexity CU I thought that
bit more complexity CU I thought that was a bit too simple I want to give you
was a bit too simple I want to give you
was a bit too simple I want to give you guys a bit more of an advanced example
guys a bit more of an advanced example
guys a bit more of an advanced example so that you really see how you can apply
so that you really see how you can apply
so that you really see how you can apply this to difficult problems within
this to difficult problems within
this to difficult problems within businesses or even within your own maybe
businesses or even within your own maybe
businesses or even within your own maybe you're an employee and you do this stuff
you're an employee and you do this stuff
you're an employee and you do this stuff so if the email comes in and it
so if the email comes in and it
so if the email comes in and it classifies it as an order status inquiry
classifies it as an order status inquiry
classifies it as an order status inquiry if it's been 0 to 7 Days the process is
if it's been 0 to 7 Days the process is
if it's been 0 to 7 Days the process is basically to reassure them that hey look
basically to reassure them that hey look
basically to reassure them that hey look usually take 7 to 10 days um please just
usually take 7 to 10 days um please just
usually take 7 to 10 days um please just wait a few days you can track your order
wait a few days you can track your order
wait a few days you can track your order here at this ra but if it's over 8 days
here at this ra but if it's over 8 days
here at this ra but if it's over 8 days then this thing is going to go back and
then this thing is going to go back and
then this thing is going to go back and say hey look I'm going to be looking
say hey look I'm going to be looking
say hey look I'm going to be looking into this for you this should be here by
into this for you this should be here by
into this for you this should be here by now and that's basically buying the
now and that's basically buying the
now and that's basically buying the human teen time so in the real world um
human teen time so in the real world um
human teen time so in the real world um this is an autoresponder that deals with
this is an autoresponder that deals with
this is an autoresponder that deals with as much of the stuff up front as it can
as much of the stuff up front as it can
as much of the stuff up front as it can like hey your order should be on the way
like hey your order should be on the way
like hey your order should be on the way no worries just check this page but if
no worries just check this page but if
no worries just check this page but if it's gone over that then it can flag the
it's gone over that then it can flag the
it's gone over that then it can flag the human team and say hey look um give an
human team and say hey look um give an
human team and say hey look um give an instant response to the customer so that
instant response to the customer so that
instant response to the customer so that they're not sitting there getting all
they're not sitting there getting all
they're not sitting there getting all anti because they're not getting a
anti because they're not getting a
anti because they're not getting a response and basically buys the team
response and basically buys the team
response and basically buys the team time to look into it and then come in
time to look into it and then come in
time to look into it and then come in with another response the same thing
with another response the same thing
with another response the same thing happens with uh return and refund
happens with uh return and refund
happens with uh return and refund requests here obviously for most
requests here obviously for most
requests here obviously for most e-commerce stores they've got maybe
e-commerce stores they've got maybe
e-commerce stores they've got maybe 30-day returns policy so um part of the

that's all on the school community and
that's all on the school community and here I've generated some example
here I've generated some example
here I've generated some example responses so as you can see uh we are
responses so as you can see uh we are
responses so as you can see uh we are expecting inputs of customer email and
expecting inputs of customer email and
expecting inputs of customer email and number of days since purchase so the
number of days since purchase so the
number of days since purchase so the inputs we have this QA format QA QA
inputs we have this QA format QA QA
inputs we have this QA format QA QA question answer question answer this
question answer question answer this
question answer question answer this will make a bit more sense when we do
will make a bit more sense when we do
will make a bit more sense when we do the drafting step next but basically we
the drafting step next but basically we
the drafting step next but basically we have the input of the email and we have
have the input of the email and we have
have the input of the email and we have um the number of days since purchase and
um the number of days since purchase and
um the number of days since purchase and this is the expected output so we have
this is the expected output so we have
this is the expected output so we have one pair here and an example input and
one pair here and an example input and
one pair here and an example input and output and then we have another pair
output and then we have another pair
output and then we have another pair here slightly different and the example
here slightly different and the example
here slightly different and the example output
output
output and the input here and another output
and the input here and another output
and the input here and another output example as well so these kinds of input
example as well so these kinds of input
example as well so these kinds of input and output pairs are really essential to
and output pairs are really essential to
and output pairs are really essential to make sure that the output is coming in
make sure that the output is coming in
make sure that the output is coming in the right format right tone of voice um
the right format right tone of voice um
the right format right tone of voice um and you guys will see in a second how
and you guys will see in a second how
and you guys will see in a second how when we bake this into the prompt we can
when we bake this into the prompt we can
when we bake this into the prompt we can even turn it on and off and see how much
even turn it on and off and see how much
even turn it on and off and see how much of a difference this makes so we have
of a difference this makes so we have
of a difference this makes so we have our examples here so we can go back to
our examples here so we can go back to
our examples here so we can go back to our prompting sheet um we can say client
our prompting sheet um we can say client
our prompting sheet um we can say client has provided they are included in the
has provided they are included in the
has provided they are included in the brief and can this be done in one step
brief and can this be done in one step
brief and can this be done in one step now in this case I'd say yes but
now in this case I'd say yes but
now in this case I'd say yes but sometimes you may need to chain multiple
sometimes you may need to chain multiple
sometimes you may need to chain multiple prompts together for example you may
prompts together for example you may
prompts together for example you may want to throw a whole bunch of
want to throw a whole bunch of
want to throw a whole bunch of information in and get it to write an
information in and get it to write an
information in and get it to write an outline and then it needs to go over
outline and then it needs to go over
outline and then it needs to go over that outline and kind of approve that it
that outline and kind of approve that it
that outline and kind of approve that it meets some kind of criteria or way that
meets some kind of criteria or way that
meets some kind of criteria or way that you like to structure your videos and
you like to structure your videos and
you like to structure your videos and then you need to do another step after
then you need to do another step after
then you need to do another step after that that's going to actually flesh it
that that's going to actually flesh it
that that's going to actually flesh it out into say a script or or into some
out into say a script or or into some
out into say a script or or into some piece of content that you want to write
piece of content that you want to write
piece of content that you want to write so sometimes it's called prompt chaining
so sometimes it's called prompt chaining
so sometimes it's called prompt chaining and you want to do multiple steps where
and you want to do multiple steps where
and you want to do multiple steps where it's you're asking a bit too much for it
it's you're asking a bit too much for it
it's you're asking a bit too much for it to do it all in one step but in this
to do it all in one step but in this
to do it all in one step but in this case we can do the classification of
case we can do the classification of
case we can do the classification of what type it is and also the generation
what type it is and also the generation
what type it is and also the generation of the response Allin one go you could
of the response Allin one go you could
of the response Allin one go you could split that out into okay let's do a
split that out into okay let's do a
split that out into okay let's do a classifier first that's more specialized
classifier first that's more specialized
classifier first that's more specialized in the writing of the responses rather
in the writing of the responses rather
in the writing of the responses rather than of the classification but in this
than of the classification but in this
than of the classification but in this case I think it's Overkill can this be
case I think it's Overkill can this be
case I think it's Overkill can this be done in one step yes and which model
done in one step yes and which model
done in one step yes and which model should be used this really comes down to
should be used this really comes down to
should be used this really comes down to a number of factors like how much is
a number of factors like how much is
a number of factors like how much is this going to be used if this is going

times a month when it comes to the model
times a month when it comes to the model we need to be thinking about what is
we need to be thinking about what is
we need to be thinking about what is this task for what context is it and how
this task for what context is it and how
this task for what context is it and how many times is it going to be used how
many times is it going to be used how
many times is it going to be used how difficult is the task so for more
difficult is the task so for more
difficult is the task so for more difficult tasks you're obviously going
difficult tasks you're obviously going
difficult tasks you're obviously going to want to go for the more expensive and
to want to go for the more expensive and
to want to go for the more expensive and and smarter models which typically do
and smarter models which typically do
and smarter models which typically do cost more but at the at the same time if
cost more but at the at the same time if
cost more but at the at the same time if this thing is going to be running
this thing is going to be running
this thing is going to be running thousands and thousands of times a month
thousands and thousands of times a month
thousands and thousands of times a month you may have a bit of a trade-off where
you may have a bit of a trade-off where
you may have a bit of a trade-off where hey we need a really intelligent model
hey we need a really intelligent model
hey we need a really intelligent model and we needed a lot so what's the best
and we needed a lot so what's the best
and we needed a lot so what's the best trade-off here how can I get it to work
trade-off here how can I get it to work
trade-off here how can I get it to work with the cheapest model possible or if
with the cheapest model possible or if
with the cheapest model possible or if it's only going to be used maybe a
it's only going to be used maybe a
it's only going to be used maybe a handful or a few dozen times a month
handful or a few dozen times a month
handful or a few dozen times a month then you may as well just go for a very
then you may as well just go for a very
then you may as well just go for a very smart model and just get the best
smart model and just get the best
smart model and just get the best results from it so in the cases where
results from it so in the cases where
results from it so in the cases where there's super high volume you're going
there's super high volume you're going
there's super high volume you're going to want to try and get the cheapest
to want to try and get the cheapest
to want to try and get the cheapest model possible but that can make a
model possible but that can make a
model possible but that can make a little bit more difficult and require a
little bit more difficult and require a
little bit more difficult and require a bit more prompt engineering but that's
bit more prompt engineering but that's
bit more prompt engineering but that's really where the value of of being a
really where the value of of being a
really where the value of of being a good prompt engineer and and having a
good prompt engineer and and having a
good prompt engineer and and having a good process comes from which is you can
good process comes from which is you can
good process comes from which is you can get better performance out of Cheaper
get better performance out of Cheaper
get better performance out of Cheaper models where other people have to rely
models where other people have to rely
models where other people have to rely on really really expensive ones you can
on really really expensive ones you can
on really really expensive ones you can use much cheaper ones with better
use much cheaper ones with better
use much cheaper ones with better instructions and get the same or even a
instructions and get the same or even a
instructions and get the same or even a better result so in this case because it
better result so in this case because it
better result so in this case because it is a kind of writing task I'm going to
is a kind of writing task I'm going to
is a kind of writing task I'm going to go with uh
go with uh
go with uh Claude son it 3.7 which is come out
Claude son it 3.7 which is come out
Claude son it 3.7 which is come out recently which is the best smartest
recently which is the best smartest
recently which is the best smartest writing model but that is really just
writing model but that is really just
writing model but that is really just the starting point we can Benchmark it
the starting point we can Benchmark it
the starting point we can Benchmark it with that and then we can try to go down
with that and then we can try to go down
with that and then we can try to go down to cheaper and cheaper models even
to cheaper and cheaper models even
to cheaper and cheaper models even within the CLA family but we want to
within the CLA family but we want to
within the CLA family but we want to Benchmark it and see just how good we
Benchmark it and see just how good we
Benchmark it and see just how good we can get it and then if we can use our
can get it and then if we can use our
can get it and then if we can use our engineering to work that model down to
engineering to work that model down to
engineering to work that model down to something cheaper and cheaper and does
something cheaper and cheaper and does
something cheaper and cheaper and does the client have specific requests none
the client have specific requests none
the client have specific requests none aside from in the brief okay so step two
aside from in the brief okay so step two
aside from in the brief okay so step two of the planning sheet is actually
of the planning sheet is actually
of the planning sheet is actually requirement Gathering so this is
requirement Gathering so this is
requirement Gathering so this is prepping everything that we're going to
prepping everything that we're going to
prepping everything that we're going to be putting into our AI tool in a second
be putting into our AI tool in a second
be putting into our AI tool in a second and a lot of this I'm just going to be a
and a lot of this I'm just going to be a
and a lot of this I'm just going to be a to grab directly from our sheet but this
to grab directly from our sheet but this
to grab directly from our sheet but this is really where you collect a lot of the
is really where you collect a lot of the
is really where you collect a lot of the information that's going to allow you to
information that's going to allow you to
information that's going to allow you to rapidly draft it in the next step so the
rapidly draft it in the next step so the
rapidly draft it in the next step so the purpose of this prompt I can go back to
purpose of this prompt I can go back to
purpose of this prompt I can go back to here maybe grab all of this and just
here maybe grab all of this and just
here maybe grab all of this and just take it back over inputs again this is
take it back over inputs again this is
take it back over inputs again this is similar to what we had just up here we
similar to what we had just up here we
similar to what we had just up here we can just grab
these and a bit of context so this is
these and a bit of context so this is the email and then days of purchase
the email and then days of purchase
the email and then days of purchase number of days since the cost be used
number of days since the cost be used
number of days since the cost be used for this is to be used for determining
for this is to be used for determining
for this is to be used for determining actions um such as refund request and
actions um such as refund request and
actions um such as refund request and now that we're at this IP section it's
now that we're at this IP section it's
now that we're at this IP section it's asking for the secret Source or
asking for the secret Source or
asking for the secret Source or methodology which we have in the brief
methodology which we have in the brief
methodology which we have in the brief here so if we go response categories and
here so if we go response categories and
here so if we go response categories and guidelines copy all of this
we actually had this information here um
we actually had this information here um maybe I'll just grab that and put it in
maybe I'll just grab that and put it in
maybe I'll just grab that and put it in as well this is the IP or secret
source and for the output we can just do
source and for the output we can just do similar to what we had before so this
similar to what we had before so this
similar to what we had before so this step one of exploration is just to get
step one of exploration is just to get
step one of exploration is just to get your thoughts out on the page and make
your thoughts out on the page and make
your thoughts out on the page and make sure that you know what you're doing
sure that you know what you're doing
sure that you know what you're doing when you head into the second phase here
when you head into the second phase here
when you head into the second phase here so if we go down
so if we go down
so if we go down and plain text emo response and then for
and plain text emo response and then for
and plain text emo response and then for the examples we can go back down and
the examples we can go back down and
the examples we can go back down and grab our examples from the a client
brief well we've got that there and at
brief well we've got that there and at the bottom of the sheet there's actually
the bottom of the sheet there's actually
the bottom of the sheet there's actually another finished example so that if you
another finished example so that if you
another finished example so that if you are doing another prompt you can look at
are doing another prompt you can look at
are doing another prompt you can look at this and get an idea of how you can fill
this and get an idea of how you can fill
this and get an idea of how you can fill that out for a different kind of prompt
that out for a different kind of prompt
that out for a different kind of prompt and as I said this is from accelerator
and as I said this is from accelerator
and as I said this is from accelerator so there's some other stuff here and the
so there's some other stuff here and the
so there's some other stuff here and the next step is to use our plan in
next step is to use our plan in
next step is to use our plan in generating our draft which we're going

need to load up our prompt into prompt
need to load up our prompt into prompt metheus we need to run some inputs

actually getting the classification
actually getting the classification correct so testing all of these things
correct so testing all of these things
correct so testing all of these things is what the evaluation step is with this
is what the evaluation step is with this
is what the evaluation step is with this initial draft so to get things set up in

going to add this block as
going to add this block as roll and you'll see why we start to
roll and you'll see why we start to

separate them into these different
separate them into these different chunks as it makes it a lot easier for
chunks as it makes it a lot easier for

us to test things so we have our roll in
us to test things so we have our roll in here I'm going to add another block
here I'm going to add another block
here I'm going to add another block here that's the task this
here that's the task this
here that's the task this time I am going to leave that off
I'm just going to skip over the data
I'm just going to skip over the data here for now because we need to do
here for now because we need to do
here for now because we need to do something that's a little bit different
something that's a little bit different
something that's a little bit different for this um which is going to take in
for this um which is going to take in
for this um which is going to take in the various different inputs we want to
the various different inputs we want to
the various different inputs we want to test so we can get specifics
so what you can see me doing here is
so what you can see me doing here is putting the markdown formatting in so
putting the markdown formatting in so
putting the markdown formatting in so this just helps the AI to understand the
this just helps the AI to understand the
this just helps the AI to understand the structure of the prompt better so this
structure of the prompt better so this
structure of the prompt better so this is it's reading this as a heading and
is it's reading this as a heading and
is it's reading this as a heading and this is a like an H2 or or a heading two
this is a like an H2 or or a heading two
this is a like an H2 or or a heading two um so it gives it a lot more structure
um so it gives it a lot more structure
um so it gives it a lot more structure so this is a specific section this is

well so now I can do the same with the
well so now I can do the same with the examples
and now we could just grab the notes
and now we could just grab the notes Here
we have all the different components of
we have all the different components of the prompt split up into the different
the prompt split up into the different
the prompt split up into the different sections so that's going to make it very
sections so that's going to make it very
sections so that's going to make it very easy for us to test in a second but the
easy for us to test in a second but the
easy for us to test in a second but the last step before we actually start
last step before we actually start
last step before we actually start evaluating is we need to go and insert
evaluating is we need to go and insert
evaluating is we need to go and insert the variable or the data set like I said
the variable or the data set like I said
the variable or the data set like I said earlier we want to be able to test this
earlier we want to be able to test this
earlier we want to be able to test this against multiple different inputs and
against multiple different inputs and
against multiple different inputs and determine if it's working as expected so
determine if it's working as expected so
determine if it's working as expected so promp neus allows us to do this very
promp neus allows us to do this very
promp neus allows us to do this very easily by going into what's called data
easily by going into what's called data
easily by going into what's called data sets and if I go back to the uh

information that was provided by the client or the brief for the project I
client or the brief for the project I
client or the brief for the project I have all of the input data here so we
have all of the input data here so we
have all of the input data here so we have these
have these
have these peers we can go this is the email and

the from in the subject which you could
the from in the subject which you could probably kill and and take out we have
probably kill and and take out we have
probably kill and and take out we have the same format in the examples here so
the same format in the examples here so
the same format in the examples here so the email and then the day since
the email and then the day since
the email and then the day since purchase so that's the input format that
purchase so that's the input format that
purchase so that's the input format that is expecting and also just to make it a
is expecting and also just to make it a
is expecting and also just to make it a bit easier we can say rename this here
bit easier we can say rename this here
bit easier we can say rename this here with this little rename button on the
with this little rename button on the
with this little rename button on the side you can say this is our

um Tech Gear
um Tech Gear Pro email we can also rename our data
Pro email we can also rename our data
Pro email we can also rename our data dat set here um Tech Gear
dat set here um Tech Gear
dat set here um Tech Gear Pro and so this is one item in the data
Pro and so this is one item in the data

set this will all make sense in a second so stick with me if we then go add
so stick with me if we then go add
so stick with me if we then go add another
another
another item we go back to
this add another item so I've got 10 of

want to give you a few more tips here um
want to give you a few more tips here um just so you can play around more levers
just so you can play around more levers
just so you can play around more levers that you can pull and there are a few
that you can pull and there are a few
that you can pull and there are a few big ones here and this actually really
big ones here and this actually really

helps you to understand prompt
helps you to understand prompt engineering on on a much deeper level

engineering on on a much deeper level because say here we have the switch
because say here we have the switch
because say here we have the switch where we can toggle things on and off so
where we can toggle things on and off so
where we can toggle things on and off so entire sections can be toggled on and
entire sections can be toggled on and
entire sections can be toggled on and off so we can do some interesting
off so we can do some interesting
off so we can do some interesting experiments like okay if I turn off the
experiments like okay if I turn off the
experiments like okay if I turn off the roll section and then I run this again
roll section and then I run this again
roll section and then I run this again is it going to come out much different
is it going to come out much different
is it going to come out much different to what it just
did so looks like it's pretty much the
did so looks like it's pretty much the same there so it appears that the roll
same there so it appears that the roll
same there so it appears that the roll is not actually adding much to it in
is not actually adding much to it in
is not actually adding much to it in this case likely because we've got so
this case likely because we've got so
this case likely because we've got so much context elsewhere but this is a

fairly straightforward use case and we
fairly straightforward use case and we are using quite a powerful model which
are using quite a powerful model which
are using quite a powerful model which is something we can test in a second
is something we can test in a second

actually is bringing that model quality
actually is bringing that model quality down and seeing if we can get the same
down and seeing if we can get the same
down and seeing if we can get the same results with an even cheaper model um or

another good one that I like to do is
another good one that I like to do is turning off the examples and seeing if
turning off the examples and seeing if
turning off the examples and seeing if they're actually making a difference
they're actually making a difference
they're actually making a difference because in a lot of cases your examples
because in a lot of cases your examples
because in a lot of cases your examples are going to be a massive massive amount

and and therefore your example section
and and therefore your example section is gigantic um but in this case let's
is gigantic um but in this case let's
is gigantic um but in this case let's just turn off our examples and we'll
just turn off our examples and we'll
just turn off our examples and we'll give it a spin and see how this one
give it a spin and see how this one
give it a spin and see how this one comes out I actually there is a bit of a

the example section where we have it
the example section where we have it here but not in here is not actually

doing that much so you can see how you
doing that much so you can see how you can start to test and figure out what
can start to test and figure out what
can start to test and figure out what parts of the prompt are actually moving
parts of the prompt are actually moving
parts of the prompt are actually moving the needle what parts are needed um that
the needle what parts are needed um that
the needle what parts are needed um that actually isn't isn't a green thumb so if
actually isn't isn't a green thumb so if
actually isn't isn't a green thumb so if we turn everything back
we turn everything back
we turn everything back on I've shown you guys how you can
on I've shown you guys how you can
on I've shown you guys how you can create new versions of sections easiest
create new versions of sections easiest
create new versions of sections easiest way is to right click on one of these
way is to right click on one of these
way is to right click on one of these tabs and click duplicate and it's going
tabs and click duplicate and it's going
tabs and click duplicate and it's going to give you a and a duplicate version of
to give you a and a duplicate version of
to give you a and a duplicate version of that you can make changes to it chops
that you can make changes to it chops
that you can make changes to it chops and bits out and the last test that I'd
and bits out and the last test that I'd
and bits out and the last test that I'd want to do here is see if we can get the
want to do here is see if we can get the
want to do here is see if we can get the same performance um let's just run
same performance um let's just run
same performance um let's just run through a couple of these there we go um
four five and six so we'll just get
four five and six so we'll just get these filled out using the uh the best
these filled out using the uh the best
these filled out using the uh the best prompt that we know is is performing how
prompt that we know is is performing how
prompt that we know is is performing how we want it to and there we go we have
we want it to and there we go we have
we want it to and there we go we have all of these responses let's just double
all of these responses let's just double
all of these responses let's just double check this last one number six this is a
check this last one number six this is a
check this last one number six this is a technical support one and it seems to be
technical support one and it seems to be
technical support one and it seems to be dealing with that correctly there so
dealing with that correctly there so
dealing with that correctly there so that's good this is performing as
that's good this is performing as
that's good this is performing as expected now if we change this down to a
expected now if we change this down to a
expected now if we change this down to a cheaper version of claude's model so 3.5
cheaper version of claude's model so 3.5
cheaper version of claude's model so 3.5 hiu and we run this on six here and then
hiu and we run this on six here and then
hiu and we run this on six here and then we compare
we compare
we compare them now actually this probably isn't a
them now actually this probably isn't a
them now actually this probably isn't a fair comparison because uh this part
fair comparison because uh this part
fair comparison because uh this part with this tech support kind of questions
with this tech support kind of questions
with this tech support kind of questions it is coming up with its own AI
it is coming up with its own AI
it is coming up with its own AI generated responses to we don't actually
generated responses to we don't actually
generated responses to we don't actually have a knowledge base on tech support
have a knowledge base on tech support
have a knowledge base on tech support which is what you do with more of an
which is what you do with more of an
which is what you do with more of an agent based build but if we go back to
agent based build but if we go back to
agent based build but if we go back to um let's just do one two and three again
um let's just do one two and three again
um let's just do one two and three again so an easy way of doing this would be to
so an easy way of doing this would be to
so an easy way of doing this would be to just go to High and we'll run
just go to High and we'll run
just go to High and we'll run one and then we'll switch to Sonet 3.7
one and then we'll switch to Sonet 3.7
one and then we'll switch to Sonet 3.7 and we'll compare it side by
and we'll compare it side by
and we'll compare it side by side and it appears that we are
side and it appears that we are
side and it appears that we are getting yeah pretty much the same thing
