            Today at Oxford I had the most peculiar conversation with young Tolkien. 
            He was going on about his invented languages again, creating words for 
            elves and dragons as if they were as real as the students in our tutorial. 
            I must admit, there's something rather wonderful about his enthusiasm for 
            these imaginary realms. Perhaps there's more truth in fairy stories than 
            we academics typically allow.
