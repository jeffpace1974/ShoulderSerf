- Applied 4-criteria thumbnail text extraction protocol

## Backup Strategy
**Important**: Database files (*.db) are excluded from git repository via .gitignore for good reason:
- Large file size (131+ MB)
- Frequent updates during scraping
- Binary format not suitable for version control

**Current Backup Method**:
1. Local timestamped backups created during major updates
2. Database verification runs confirm integrity
3. Search functionality tested after each update
4. Repository contains all code and templates for regeneration

## Database Recreation
The database can be fully recreated from the YouTube channel using:
```bash
python3 youtube_cli.py --db captions_backup.db channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChptV-kf8lnncGh7DA2m8Pw"
```
