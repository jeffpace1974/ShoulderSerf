you probably suck at promt engineering
you probably suck at promt engineering and in this video I'm going to tell you
and in this video I'm going to tell you
and in this video I'm going to tell you why how you can fix it and how you
why how you can fix it and how you
why how you can fix it and how you cannot be the guy in the middle here of
cannot be the guy in the middle here of
cannot be the guy in the middle here of this mid with me so that's might a
this mid with me so that's might a
this mid with me so that's might a little bit off topic but if you give me
little bit off topic but if you give me
little bit off topic but if you give me a second I'll explain how this applies
a second I'll explain how this applies
a second I'll explain how this applies to the majority of people who are trying
to the majority of people who are trying
to the majority of people who are trying to do prompt engineering and build AI
to do prompt engineering and build AI
to do prompt engineering and build AI systems and why it's probably holding
systems and why it's probably holding
systems and why it's probably holding you back because you're stuck in this
you back because you're stuck in this
you back because you're stuck in this midwit range so if you haven't seen this
midwit range so if you haven't seen this
midwit range so if you haven't seen this meme before basically the low IQ people
meme before basically the low IQ people
meme before basically the low IQ people and the high IQ people kind of converge
and the high IQ people kind of converge
and the high IQ people kind of converge on the same solution uh as you see here
on the same solution uh as you see here
on the same solution uh as you see here so we have the guy using Apple notes on
so we have the guy using Apple notes on
so we have the guy using Apple notes on one side and the genius using Apple
one side and the genius using Apple
one side and the genius using Apple notes on one side and in the middle you
notes on one side and in the middle you
notes on one side and in the middle you have the midwit who's over complicating
have the midwit who's over complicating
have the midwit who's over complicating it making it very difficult and painful
it making it very difficult and painful
it making it very difficult and painful for themselves and then we have the same
for themselves and then we have the same
for themselves and then we have the same thing with NES Cafe Classic on both
thing with NES Cafe Classic on both
thing with NES Cafe Classic on both sides and in the middle we have the
sides and in the middle we have the
sides and in the middle we have the midwit struggling with all these
midwit struggling with all these
midwit struggling with all these different types of coffee and fancy
different types of coffee and fancy
different types of coffee and fancy methods so how does this apply to prompt
methods so how does this apply to prompt
methods so how does this apply to prompt engineering I know you're asking
engineering I know you're asking
engineering I know you're asking considering you clicked on a video
considering you clicked on a video
considering you clicked on a video that's about prompt engineering but it's
that's about prompt engineering but it's
that's about prompt engineering but it's actually a not so bow curve when it
actually a not so bow curve when it
actually a not so bow curve when it comes to prompt engineering and uh on
comes to prompt engineering and uh on
comes to prompt engineering and uh on the far left we have the stupid person
the far left we have the stupid person
the far left we have the stupid person who is just using chat GPT and prompting
who is just using chat GPT and prompting
who is just using chat GPT and prompting it as they wish kind of just throwing
it as they wish kind of just throwing
it as they wish kind of just throwing things in there on the far side we have
things in there on the far side we have
things in there on the far side we have what we're trying to get you to after
what we're trying to get you to after
what we're trying to get you to after this video which is a genius who has a
this video which is a genius who has a
this video which is a genius who has a toolkit of prompts and understands the
toolkit of prompts and understands the
toolkit of prompts and understands the science behind it and in the middle we
science behind it and in the middle we
science behind it and in the middle we have probably you right now which is uh
have probably you right now which is uh
have probably you right now which is uh I mean no no disrespect to these other
I mean no no disrespect to these other
I mean no no disrespect to these other YouTubers cuz I've made videos on on
YouTubers cuz I've made videos on on
YouTubers cuz I've made videos on on proing myself like I'm I'm I'm part of
proing myself like I'm I'm I'm part of
proing myself like I'm I'm I'm part of the problem here but uh what these are
the problem here but uh what these are
the problem here but uh what these are all about is chat gbt prompt templates
all about is chat gbt prompt templates
all about is chat gbt prompt templates and and sort of taking the thinking away
and and sort of taking the thinking away
and and sort of taking the thinking away from you and putting it in the hands of
from you and putting it in the hands of
from you and putting it in the hands of this template that they've created so uh
this template that they've created so uh
this template that they've created so uh I'm not going to sh on my videos too
I'm not going to sh on my videos too
I'm not going to sh on my videos too much uh because these videos were
much uh because these videos were

going to go into this video point of
going to go into this video point of this video is to take you from someone
this video is to take you from someone
this video is to take you from someone who's on that Plateau as you can see
who's on that Plateau as you can see

who's able to do great things with these
who's able to do great things with these language models and it's so important
language models and it's so important
language models and it's so important because your ability to prompt them and
because your ability to prompt them and
because your ability to prompt them and and provide instruction of these models

English to codee that's one way of
English to codee that's one way of programming in English technically but
programming in English technically but
programming in English technically but another way is that if you can write
another way is that if you can write
another way is that if you can write effective prompts you can replace the
effective prompts you can replace the
effective prompts you can replace the the the programming required with a
the the programming required with a
the the programming required with a massive program or a massive script you
massive program or a massive script you
massive program or a massive script you can write a prompt that effectively does
can write a prompt that effectively does
can write a prompt that effectively does all of the things that that that script
all of the things that that that script
all of the things that that that script would have done so you can replace large
would have done so you can replace large
would have done so you can replace large blocks of code with a well-written
blocks of code with a well-written
blocks of code with a well-written prompt now which is really what I want
prompt now which is really what I want

doing your prod engineering and what
doing your prod engineering and what I've learned and what I now use is from
I've learned and what I now use is from
I've learned and what I now use is from him so you might think I'm just some

paid people who are a lot smarter than me to give me this knowledge so now I'm
me to give me this knowledge so now I'm
me to give me this knowledge so now I'm giving it to you so now I want you to
giving it to you so now I want you to
giving it to you so now I want you to remember this a well-written prompt can
remember this a well-written prompt can
remember this a well-written prompt can replace hundreds of lines of code going
replace hundreds of lines of code going
replace hundreds of lines of code going back to what I said before this is I
back to what I said before this is I
back to what I said before this is I think it's my quote but I'm just going
think it's my quote but I'm just going
think it's my quote but I'm just going to say someone said it cuz someone must
to say someone said it cuz someone must
to say someone said it cuz someone must have said it but that's essentially what
have said it but that's essentially what
have said it but that's essentially what you can do if you write a well-written
you can do if you write a well-written
you can do if you write a well-written prompt um now here's an example so
prompt um now here's an example so
prompt um now here's an example so there's there a video that will have
there's there a video that will have
there's there a video that will have just gone out recently on my channel
just gone out recently on my channel
just gone out recently on my channel where I manage my phone finances with AI
where I manage my phone finances with AI
where I manage my phone finances with AI I set up a system where my assistant can
I set up a system where my assistant can
I set up a system where my assistant can send money I can send screenshots these
send money I can send screenshots these
send money I can send screenshots these things here through the system and out
things here through the system and out
things here through the system and out comes the other side a tracker for all
comes the other side a tracker for all
comes the other side a tracker for all my expenses within my notion um it
my expenses within my notion um it
my expenses within my notion um it automatically extracts the extracts the
automatically extracts the extracts the
automatically extracts the extracts the transactions from the screenshots
transactions from the screenshots
transactions from the screenshots categorizes them stores them in my
categorizes them stores them in my
categorizes them stores them in my expense data database within the notion
expense data database within the notion
expense data database within the notion and this is kind of the system here you
and this is kind of the system here you
and this is kind of the system here you can pause and take a look but basically
can pause and take a look but basically
can pause and take a look but basically so it took me 2 hours to write a very
so it took me 2 hours to write a very
so it took me 2 hours to write a very good prompt that can success categorized
good prompt that can success categorized
good prompt that can success categorized format and then pass the data over to
format and then pass the data over to
format and then pass the data over to notion um and that's ended up saving 8
notion um and that's ended up saving 8
notion um and that's ended up saving 8 hours per month for my system so example
hours per month for my system so example
hours per month for my system so example there not the best one but you get the
there not the best one but you get the
there not the best one but you get the idea um if you write a good prompt you
idea um if you write a good prompt you
idea um if you write a good prompt you can replace what would have taken like
can replace what would have taken like
can replace what would have taken like to me for me to do this expensive system
to me for me to do this expensive system
to me for me to do this expensive system with code would have taken a a whole lot
with code would have taken a a whole lot
with code would have taken a a whole lot longer and it would have been extremely
longer and it would have been extremely
longer and it would have been extremely messy um but the AI can just throw all
messy um but the AI can just throw all
messy um but the AI can just throw all the information at it say hey look this
the information at it say hey look this
the information at it say hey look this is what I want you to do with it and
is what I want you to do with it and
is what I want you to do with it and outcomes the transactions ready to go
outcomes the transactions ready to go
outcomes the transactions ready to go into notion and no we're still not ready
into notion and no we're still not ready
into notion and no we're still not ready to move forward because you need to
to move forward because you need to
to move forward because you need to understand that if you can just get this
understand that if you can just get this
understand that if you can just get this skill right that many people don't have
skill right that many people don't have
skill right that many people don't have correct they think they can do
correct they think they can do
correct they think they can do conversational prompt engineering and
conversational prompt engineering and
conversational prompt engineering and that's going to be enough for them to go
that's going to be enough for them to go
that's going to be enough for them to go in and build these systems but in AI

soon as you add one example to this it
soon as you add one example to this it jumps up from 10 to nearly 50 to 45%
jumps up from 10 to nearly 50 to 45%
jumps up from 10 to nearly 50 to 45% accuracy and then we get sort of a a
accuracy and then we get sort of a a
accuracy and then we get sort of a a diminishing returns as we continue to
diminishing returns as we continue to
diminishing returns as we continue to increase up to here is 10 examples so
increase up to here is 10 examples so

using a lot of them and it kind of crept
using a lot of them and it kind of crept its way up uh but for us the key
its way up uh but for us the key
its way up uh but for us the key takeaways is that providing just a few
takeaways is that providing just a few

diminishing returns most of the gains
diminishing returns most of the gains can be achieved between uh 10 to 32 well
can be achieved between uh 10 to 32 well
can be achieved between uh 10 to 32 well crafted examples and personally I go for
crafted examples and personally I go for
crafted examples and personally I go for like 3 to 5 I don't really want to be
like 3 to 5 I don't really want to be
like 3 to 5 I don't really want to be sitting there all day writing all these
sitting there all day writing all these
sitting there all day writing all these examples and the more examples you give
examples and the more examples you give
examples and the more examples you give the more tokens you're putting in the
the more tokens you're putting in the
the more tokens you're putting in the input of your prompt and therefore the
input of your prompt and therefore the
input of your prompt and therefore the more expensive it is every time every
more expensive it is every time every
more expensive it is every time every time you call that prompt so if it's
time you call that prompt so if it's
time you call that prompt so if it's part of this email classification system
part of this email classification system
part of this email classification system and we have 32 examples we're going to
and we have 32 examples we're going to
and we have 32 examples we're going to have 32 examples worth of context and
have 32 examples worth of context and
have 32 examples worth of context and token usage in our Automation and that
token usage in our Automation and that
token usage in our Automation and that means every single time an email comes
means every single time an email comes
means every single time an email comes in it's going to be sending off huge
in it's going to be sending off huge
in it's going to be sending off huge amounts of tokens uh as part of the

nearly 55 60 a big jump immediately just by adding a few examples but
by adding a few examples but
by adding a few examples but interestingly the gold labels here so
interestingly the gold labels here so
interestingly the gold labels here so these orange pillars these orange bars
these orange pillars these orange bars
these orange pillars these orange bars uh that refers to the tests done where
uh that refers to the tests done where
uh that refers to the tests done where the labels were correct so maybe if the
the labels were correct so maybe if the
the labels were correct so maybe if the email classification was um here's the
email classification was um here's the
email classification was um here's the email here's classification and we gave
email here's classification and we gave
email here's classification and we gave it correct examples the performance
it correct examples the performance
it correct examples the performance increase within the study was shown
increase within the study was shown
increase within the study was shown regardless of whether those labels were
regardless of whether those labels were
regardless of whether those labels were correct so this tells us something
correct so this tells us something
correct so this tells us something interesting that the llm is not strictly
interesting that the llm is not strictly
interesting that the llm is not strictly learning new information so by giving us
learning new information so by giving us
learning new information so by giving us giving it few short examples that have
giving it few short examples that have
giving it few short examples that have the correct labels it's not necessarily
the correct labels it's not necessarily
the correct labels it's not necessarily learning that information it's actually
learning that information it's actually
learning that information it's actually just learning from the format and
just learning from the format and
just learning from the format and structure uh and that helps to increase
structure uh and that helps to increase
structure uh and that helps to increase the accuracy of the outputs overall the
the accuracy of the outputs overall the
the accuracy of the outputs overall the accuracy of the label itself does not
accuracy of the label itself does not
accuracy of the label itself does not actually appear to matter too much uh on
actually appear to matter too much uh on
actually appear to matter too much uh on the on the overall performance so you
the on the overall performance so you
the on the overall performance so you can have incorrect labels and it's still
can have incorrect labels and it's still
can have incorrect labels and it's still going to perform just as well um because
going to perform just as well um because
going to perform just as well um because you've given it some examples on how it

throwing in three to five examples is
throwing in three to five examples is going to greatly increase the accuracy

have hittings uh hitting one is the largest hitting two is the second lest
largest hitting two is the second lest
largest hitting two is the second lest hting three is the third lest so you
hting three is the third lest so you
hting three is the third lest so you have now different layers of hittings so
have now different layers of hittings so
have now different layers of hittings so you can have like roll task all these in
you can have like roll task all these in
you can have like roll task all these in the hitting one so just H one as a as a
the hitting one so just H one as a as a
the hitting one so just H one as a as a pound symbol and then and then a space

and then whatever you want after it
and then whatever you want after it which you'll see in a sign um but then
which you'll see in a sign um but then
which you'll see in a sign um but then if you have little subsets or
if you have little subsets or
if you have little subsets or subsections like examples hitter and
subsections like examples hitter and
subsections like examples hitter and then you want example one you can have
then you want example one you can have
then you want example one you can have example one as a hitting three or a
example one as a hitting three or a
example one as a hitting three or a hitting two so you have different layers
hitting two so you have different layers
hitting two so you have different layers of hitting and importance uh you also

to jump into the fancy stuff I'll teach
to jump into the fancy stuff I'll teach you the basics here of markdown but you

bolds and italics and stuff but I tend
bolds and italics and stuff but I tend to just use the use the headings as a as
to just use the use the headings as a as
to just use the use the headings as a as a structure tool so key takeaways on
a structure tool so key takeaways on
a structure tool so key takeaways on markdown formatting is use these H1 tags
markdown formatting is use these H1 tags
markdown formatting is use these H1 tags single pound symbol uh to Mark each of
single pound symbol uh to Mark each of
single pound symbol uh to Mark each of the components for your prompt and then
the components for your prompt and then
the components for your prompt and then you can use the H2 or three tags or even
you can use the H2 or three tags or even
you can use the H2 or three tags or even bolds and stuff to sort of add add
bolds and stuff to sort of add add
bolds and stuff to sort of add add additional additional structure to other
additional additional structure to other
additional additional structure to other parts of it so here's example of how you
parts of it so here's example of how you
parts of it so here's example of how you should add it in hitting one roll
should add it in hitting one roll
should add it in hitting one roll hitting one task specifics context and
hitting one task specifics context and
hitting one task specifics context and then Within context I've added in here
then Within context I've added in here
then Within context I've added in here look you might want to break the context
look you might want to break the context
look you might want to break the context into subsections of okay let's use a
into subsections of okay let's use a
into subsections of okay let's use a heading 2 and go about the business
heading 2 and go about the business
heading 2 and go about the business about our system so you don't need to do
about our system so you don't need to do
about our system so you don't need to do that all the time but this is how you
that all the time but this is how you
that all the time but this is how you can start to use other types of headings
can start to use other types of headings
can start to use other types of headings in like H2 or H3 tags to to split up uh
in like H2 or H3 tags to to split up uh
in like H2 or H3 tags to to split up uh some of the other subsections under each
some of the other subsections under each
some of the other subsections under each of your main headings and then again
of your main headings and then again
of your main headings and then again examples we can have an example one as a
examples we can have an example one as a
examples we can have an example one as a as a heading three and give the examples
as a heading three and give the examples
as a heading three and give the examples and the notes so that's roughly and you

the end here you can see sometimes I
the end here you can see sometimes I like to throw this in um is after I've
like to throw this in um is after I've
like to throw this in um is after I've given examples at the bottom I'll go q
given examples at the bottom I'll go q
given examples at the bottom I'll go q and then I'll put the constraint in or
and then I'll put the constraint in or
and then I'll put the constraint in or in this case the variable uh in again
in this case the variable uh in again
in this case the variable uh in again and then I'll leave the a open up put
and then I'll leave the a open up put
and then I'll leave the a open up put space and then it's just going to kind
space and then it's just going to kind
space and then it's just going to kind of autofill that and it's a it's another
of autofill that and it's a it's another
of autofill that and it's a it's another technique you can use to to get it to
technique you can use to to get it to
technique you can use to to get it to only output uh the exact kind of uh
only output uh the exact kind of uh
only output uh the exact kind of uh output style that you want so feel free
output style that you want so feel free
output style that you want so feel free to use that as you need AI tools um you
to use that as you need AI tools um you
to use that as you need AI tools um you may not know what I mean by tools but
may not know what I mean by tools but
may not know what I mean by tools but basically we can set up a bunch of
basically we can set up a bunch of
basically we can set up a bunch of inputs say Okay Niche offer then we can
inputs say Okay Niche offer then we can
inputs say Okay Niche offer then we can insert that into a uh into a into
insert that into a uh into a into
insert that into a uh into a into pre-written prompt and then that's going
pre-written prompt and then that's going
pre-written prompt and then that's going to be allowed to connect to either gpts
to be allowed to connect to either gpts
to be allowed to connect to either gpts or you can build it um on on a on a
or you can build it um on on a on a
or you can build it um on on a on a landing page and it can be used to speed
landing page and it can be used to speed
landing page and it can be used to speed up workflows so there's so many
up workflows so there's so many
up workflows so there's so many different ways you can use it um here's
different ways you can use it um here's
different ways you can use it um here's an example again you can pause that this
an example again you can pause that this
an example again you can pause that this an example um here you can see I'm
an example um here you can see I'm
an example um here you can see I'm inserting the variables uh we have lots
inserting the variables uh we have lots
inserting the variables uh we have lots of input output Pairs and then I'm
of input output Pairs and then I'm
of input output Pairs and then I'm screaming at the end here because
